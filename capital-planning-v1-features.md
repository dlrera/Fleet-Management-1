# Capital Planning Application â€“ V1 Feature Set

This document defines the core features for version 1 of a capital planning software focused on **physical assets** (e.g., buildings, vehicles, equipment). These features represent table-stakes functionality necessary for organizations such as schools, municipalities, manufacturers, and farms.

---

## 1. Asset Inventory & Lifecycle Tracking âœ… COMPLETED
- âœ… Maintain a centralized register of all assets (buildings, vehicles, equipment).
- âœ… Store key attributes:
  - Asset name, type, category
  - Location
  - Installation/commissioning date
  - Expected useful life
  - Replacement cost
- âœ… Ability to update asset condition (e.g., Good, Fair, Poor).
- âœ… Calculate estimated replacement date based on useful life.

### Implementation Status:
- âœ… Backend models: AssetLifecycle model with all required fields
- âœ… Frontend UI: AssetLifecycleList.vue with full CRUD operations
- âœ… API endpoints: /api/cap-planning/v1/asset-lifecycle/
- âœ… Condition updates: POST /update_condition/ endpoint
- âœ… Replacement schedule: GET /replacement_schedule/ endpoint
- âœ… Maintenance analysis: GET /maintenance_analysis/ endpoint
- âœ… Additional features: Lifecycle percentage visualization, maintenance cost ratio

---

## 2. Capital Project Planning âœ… COMPLETED
- âœ… Create and manage a list of **capital projects** (e.g., equipment replacement, renovations).
- âœ… Capture project details:
  - Title, description
  - Associated asset(s)
  - Priority level
  - Scheduled year
  - Estimated cost
- âœ… Support for categorizing projects (building, fleet, equipment).

### Implementation Status:
- âœ… Backend models: CapitalProject model with all required fields
- âœ… Frontend UI: ProjectsList.vue with full CRUD operations
- âœ… Project-Asset linkage: ProjectAssetLink model with relationship types
- âœ… API endpoints: /api/cap-planning/v1/projects/
- âœ… Project approval: POST /approve/ endpoint
- âœ… Asset linking: POST /link_assets/ endpoint
- âœ… Priority matrix: GET /priority_matrix/ endpoint
- âœ… Yearly summary: GET /yearly_summary/ endpoint
- âœ… Additional features: Budget variance tracking, approval workflow

## 3. Budgeting & Forecasting ðŸ”„ PLANNED
- Multi-year capital forecast (e.g., 5â€“10 years).
- Yearly aggregation of planned expenditures.
- Compare planned spending against available budget.
- Highlight budget gaps or surpluses.

---

## 4. Cost Estimation ðŸ”„ PLANNED
- Simple cost entry for each asset/project (replacement or upgrade).
- Option to enter unit cost and quantity for transparency.
- Automatic roll-up of total costs by year and category.

---

## 5. Prioritization & Ranking ðŸ”„ PLANNED
- Basic priority scoring or ranking mechanism.
- Ability to sort/filter projects by:
  - Urgency
  - Condition
  - Year
  - Category
- Support for manual adjustment of project priority.

---

## 6. Funding Management ðŸ”„ PLANNED
- Input annual capital funding/budget.
- Allocate available funding to planned projects.
- View funded vs. unfunded projects.
- Highlight shortfalls when total projects exceed available funds.

---

## 7. Reporting & Dashboards ðŸ”„ PLANNED
- Standard reports:
  - List of capital projects with status and cost
  - Annual forecast of expenditures
  - Summary by category (e.g., buildings vs. vehicles)
- Visual dashboards:
  - Yearly spending bar chart
  - Asset replacement timeline
  - Budget vs. forecast comparison

---

## 8. Document & Data Attachments ðŸ”„ PLANNED
- Ability to attach files (photos, manuals, condition reports) to assets and projects.
- Support for notes and comments on each asset/project.

---

## 9. Basic Maintenance Data Linkage ðŸ”„ PLANNED
- Display lifetime maintenance cost for assets (manual entry or calculated).
- Compare recent maintenance cost vs. replacement cost.
- Flag assets with disproportionate maintenance cost for potential replacement.
