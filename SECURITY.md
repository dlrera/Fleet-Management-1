# Security Guidelines

## Overview
This Fleet Management System implements multiple layers of security to protect against common web application vulnerabilities and attacks.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **Token-based Authentication**: Using Django REST Framework tokens
- **Strong Password Policy**: 12+ characters with complexity requirements
- **User Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation and sanitization
- **Single Session Policy**: Only one active session per user

### 2. Brute Force Protection
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints have request rate limits
  - Login: 10 attempts per minute per IP
  - Registration: 5 attempts per minute per IP
  - Password change: 3 attempts per hour per user
- **Django Axes**: Automatic account lockout after 5 failed attempts
- **IP-based Tracking**: Failed attempts tracked by IP address

### 3. Input Security
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Django ORM prevents SQL injection
- **XSS Prevention**: Content Security Policy and input encoding
- **CSRF Protection**: Django's built-in CSRF protection enabled

### 4. Session Security
- **Secure Cookies**: HttpOnly and Secure flags in production
- **Session Timeout**: 1-hour session timeout
- **SameSite Protection**: Cookies use SameSite=Lax

### 5. Security Headers
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security
- **XSS Filter**: Browser XSS protection enabled
- **Content Type Sniffing**: Disabled to prevent MIME attacks
- **Frame Options**: X-Frame-Options set to DENY
- **Referrer Policy**: Strict origin policy

### 6. Password Security
- **Argon2 Hashing**: Industry-standard password hashing
- **Password Complexity**: Custom validator ensures strong passwords
- **Password History**: Prevents reusing current password
- **Personal Info Check**: Passwords cannot contain user information

### 7. Logging & Monitoring
- **Security Event Logging**: All authentication events logged
- **Audit Trail**: Login attempts, password changes tracked
- **Separate Security Log**: Dedicated security.log file
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information disclosure

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
Always use strong, unique values for:
- `SECRET_KEY`: 50+ character random string
- `DATABASE_URL`: Secure database credentials
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: Restrict to your domain only

### Production Security Checklist

#### Django Settings
- [ ] `DEBUG = False`
- [ ] Strong `SECRET_KEY` (different from development)
- [ ] `ALLOWED_HOSTS` set to your domain
- [ ] `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True`
- [ ] `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000`
- [ ] `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True`
- [ ] `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True`

#### Database Security
- [ ] Use PostgreSQL in production (not SQLite)
- [ ] Database user has minimal required permissions
- [ ] Database connection uses SSL
- [ ] Strong database password
- [ ] Database not accessible from public internet

#### Server Security
- [ ] HTTPS certificate properly configured
- [ ] Server firewall configured (only ports 80, 443 open)
- [ ] Regular security updates applied
- [ ] Log monitoring configured
- [ ] Backup strategy implemented

#### Application Security
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Security vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Code review process
- [ ] Error monitoring configured

## Security Monitoring

### Log Files
- `backend/logs/security.log`: Authentication events, failed attempts
- `backend/logs/django.log`: General application logs

### Key Security Events
- Failed login attempts
- Account lockouts
- Password changes
- User registrations
- Token generation/deletion

### Monitoring Alerts
Set up alerts for:
- Multiple failed login attempts from same IP
- Unusual login patterns
- Admin account activities
- Error rate spikes

## Vulnerability Response

### Incident Response Plan
1. **Immediate Response**: Disable affected accounts, block suspicious IPs
2. **Investigation**: Review logs, identify scope of incident
3. **Containment**: Apply security patches, update credentials
4. **Recovery**: Restore services, monitor for continued attacks
5. **Post-Incident**: Update security measures, document lessons learned

### Regular Security Tasks
- **Weekly**: Review security logs for suspicious activity
- **Monthly**: Update dependencies, check for security advisories
- **Quarterly**: Conduct security audit, review access permissions
- **Annually**: Penetration testing, security architecture review

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:
1. Do NOT create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security details to [security@yourcompany.com]
3. Include steps to reproduce the issue
4. Allow 90 days for response before public disclosure

## Additional Security Measures

### Recommended Enhancements
- [ ] Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- [ ] Email verification for registration
- [ ] Password reset via email
- [ ] Account activity notifications
- [ ] API versioning and deprecation strategy
- [ ] Content Security Policy headers
- [ ] Regular security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

### Third-Party Security Services
Consider integrating:
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Cloudflare, AWS WAF
- **Security Monitoring**: Sentry, DataDog Security
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Snyk, OWASP ZAP
- **SSL/TLS Monitoring**: SSL Labs, Certificate Transparency logs

## Compliance & Standards

This implementation follows security guidelines from:
- OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- Django Security Best Practices
- REST API Security Standards

**Remember**: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup. Regularly review and update your security measures as threats evolve.
