## Recent Developments

### Capital Planning Module Implementation (Latest)
1. **Asset Lifecycle Management**
   - Complete asset inventory with lifecycle tracking
   - Condition assessment and replacement scheduling
   - Maintenance cost analysis and high-cost asset identification
   - Interactive lifecycle percentage visualization

2. **Capital Project Planning**
   - Project creation with priority matrix
   - Budget tracking and variance analysis
   - Project-asset linking with relationship types
   - One-click approval workflow
   - Yearly summary and priority matrix views

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - 30 backend tests covering models, views, and API endpoints
   - 19 frontend Pinia store tests with full coverage
   - UX testing completed with EXCELLENT rating
   - Fixed audit logging session_id issue for API testing

## Previous Developments

### Interface Improvements (Latest Session)
1. **Made interface more compact and less colorful**
   - Reduced component sizes and spacing
   - Removed bright colors and colorful status chips
   - Simplified tooltips and visual elements

2. **Removed dark outlines and added interactive filtering**
   - Replaced v-card elements with custom div elements to remove Vuetify outlines
   - Added clickable statistics cards that filter the asset table:
     - Active/Maintenance/Retired cards filter by status
     - Total Assets card clears all filters
   - Added visual feedback for active filter state

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Key Files Modified
- `frontend/src/views/Assets/AssetsList.vue` - Main assets list with interactive filtering
- `frontend/src/views/Assets/AssetDetail.vue` - Asset detail view with compact styling
- `backend/config/settings.py` - CORS/CSRF configuration for multiple ports

#### Frontend Architecture
- **State Management**: Pinia store with comprehensive CRUD operations
- **Testing**: 47/47 tests passing (store logic), some DOM tests fail due to component resolution
- **UI Components**: Vuetify 3 with custom styling overrides
- **API Integration**: Token-based authentication with Django backend

#### Backend Architecture  
- **Authentication**: Token-based auth with login/logout endpoints
- **Assets API**: Full CRUD with filtering, pagination, search
- **Database**: SQLite for development
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for all API endpoints

## Development Environment
- **Frontend**: Vue 3 + Vite on ports 3000/3001/3002
- **Backend**: Django on port 8000
- **Testing**: Vitest + Vue Test Utils + MSW for mocking

## Current Commands
- Frontend dev: `npm run dev` (in frontend directory)
- Backend dev: `python manage.py runserver` (in backend directory)
- Frontend tests: `npm run test` or `npm run test:ui`
- Backend tests: `python manage.py test`

## Next Steps (Pending)
1. Implement AssetCard.vue reusable component
2. Add comprehensive unit tests for all components  
3. Implement accessibility features and testing
4. Create E2E tests for critical user workflows
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Known Issues
- Some Vuetify component resolution warnings in tests (non-blocking)
- DOM-based tests fail due to component mounting issues (core logic tests pass)

## Architecture Decisions
- Chose Pinia over Vuex for state management (Vue 3 recommended)
- Used v-data-table-server for server-side pagination and filtering
- Implemented event emission pattern for clean component testing
- Used MSW for API mocking in tests instead of real backend calls

## Security Considerations
- Token-based authentication implemented
- CSRF protection configured for development
- API endpoints properly secured with permissions
- No secrets or keys committed to repository
